Hi, {{ user }}

Password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' email=email  token=token  %}
 
If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

Store Ramazanov.
